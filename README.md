# TK__Toon


By TeMyls

A simple animation application made with Python's Tkinter, PIL(Python Imaging Library), and Numpy. <\br>
This was an attempt at trying to visually and functionally clone the pixel art application !(Piskel)[https://github.com/piskelapp/piskel], but it shares none of the code and is made with my current expertise with the tools above.<\br>

The older and previous versions and be found (here)[https://github.com/TeMyls/Apps/tree/main/Tkinter%20Animation%20App] in my Tkinter repository

### Capabilities
* Adding Frames
* Deleting Frame
* Duplicating Frames
* Inserting Frames
* Clearing individual frames
* Clearing all frames
* Shapes, Circles, Squares, and Lines
* Changing the canvas, frames, and background color to have colored backgrounds on export
* Lasso tool, both freeform and rectangular, to select, delete, or move portions of the drawing
* Onion Skin
* Resizing the frame's drawable area(32x32 is the default)
* Onion Skin, showing previous and future frames
* Playing back frames in a preview with a framerate measures in FPS
* Exporting frames as GIF files and individual frames as PNG files
* Importing GIF and PNG files
* Resizing the drawable area
* Moving the drawable area
* Different brush sizes
* Mouse Centric Transformations, Rotation and shearing either the whole frame or selected areas
As of now it has basic capabilities such as adding, deleting, duplicating, and inserting frames, and onion skin, resizing the pixel area of a frame, moving the drawable area, playing frames back as a preview, and exporting or importing animations as GIF files or frames as PNG files. <\br>

In the future I plan to add the capability to swap frames, Xaolin's Woo's Antialiasing for large lines, crush lesser known bugs
