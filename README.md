# TK-Toon or Tkinter Toon: An Animation Application

By TeMyls

A simple animation application made with Python's Tkinter, PIL(Python Imaging Library), and Numpy. </br>
This was an attempt at trying to visually and functionally clone the pixel art application [Piskel](https://github.com/piskelapp/piskel), but it shares none of the code and is made with my current expertise with the tools above.</br>

The older and previous versions and be found [here](https://github.com/TeMyls/Apps/tree/main/Tkinter%20Animation%20App) in my Tkinter repository</br>
The icons used can be found at [Google Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.size=32&icon.color=%23000000&icon.style=Rounded)</br>

### Capabilities
* Adding Frames
* Deleting Frame
* Duplicating Frames
* Inserting Frames
* Clearing individual frames
* Clearing all frames
* Shapes, Circles, Squares, and Lines
* Changing the canvas, frames, and background color to have colored backgrounds on export
* Lasso tool, both freeform and rectangular, to select, delete, or move portions of the drawing
* Onion Skin
* Resizing the frame's drawable area(32x32 is the default)
* Onion Skin, showing previous and future frames
* Playing back frames in a preview with a framerate measures in FPS
* Exporting frames as GIF files and individual frames as PNG files
* Importing GIF and PNG files
* Resizing the drawable area
* Moving the drawable area
* Different brush sizes
* Mouse Centric Transformations, Rotation and shearing, applied to the whole frame or selected areas
* Frame navigation using either buttons or the arrow keys.

</br>As of now it has basic capabilities such as adding, deleting, duplicating, and inserting frames, and onion skin, resizing the pixel area of a frame, moving the drawable area, playing frames back as a preview, and exporting or importing animations as GIF files or frames as PNG files. </br>

In the future I plan to add the capability to swap frames, Xaolin's Woo's Antialiasing for large lines, and crush lesser known bugs</br>
